                In summer of 2016 me and my wife decided to go to Mexico for a one in a lifetime experience.<br/>
                We decided to take a whole month off so that we could have enough time to visit multiple states.<br/>
                Part of me always wanted to visit multiple parts of Mexico. Mexico is such a big country that it's <br/>
                almost impossible to know the whole country no matter how much you travel.

            <h3 style="color:azure">Cascadas de Agua Azul</h3>
            <p style="color:azure">
                Our first stop in the trip was to the Cascadas of Agua Azul "Blue Waterfalls"
                These beautiful waterfalls span <br/>
                for almost 7 miles. It's considered one of the 10 natural wonders of the world.

            <p style="color:azure"; element id="cascadas">
                Next on my list is the magical town of San Cristobal de las casas. This magical town was <br/>
                originally a Spanish Settlement about 300 years ago. But now it has become a popular <br/>
                international destination. This place mixes the magical feeling of an old town with the <br/>
                culinary influences of countries all over the world.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p style="color:azure">On San Cristobal de las Casas there are dozens of artisanal restaurants which cater to every <br/>
                possible food destination in the world. Migrants from all over the world have settled in this town<br/>
                situated roughly 4,000 feet up in the mountains.
